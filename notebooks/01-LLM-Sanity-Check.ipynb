      "================================\n",
      "\n",
      "Inverting a linked list means reversing the order of the nodes in the list. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it in Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Define a Node Class\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we need to define a Node class that will represent each node in the linked list. Each node should have a value and a reference to the next node in the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class Node:\n",
      "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
      "        self.value = value\n",
      "        self.next = None\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Define a LinkedList Class\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we need to define a LinkedList class that will represent the entire linked list. This class should have methods to add nodes to the list and to invert the list.\n",

      "        current = self.head\n",
      "        while current.next:\n",
      "            current = current.next\n",
      "        current.next = new_node\n",
      "\n",
      "    def invert(self):\n",
      "        # Invert the linked list\n",
      "        prev = None\n",
      "        current = self.head\n",
      "        while current:\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Test the Invert Method\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Explanation\n",
      "------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The `invert` method works by iterating through the linked list and swapping the `next` references of each node. It uses three pointers: `prev`, `current`, and `next_node`. The `prev` pointer keeps track of the previous node, the `current` pointer keeps track of the current node, and the `next_node` pointer keeps track of the next node in the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "In each iteration, it does the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Stores the next node in `next_node`.\n",
      "2.  Swaps the `next` references of the current node and the previous node.\n",
      "3.  Moves the `prev` and `current` pointers one step forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, it updates the `head` pointer to point to the new first node, which is the last node in the original list.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the pointers.\n"

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **`Node` Class:** We define a `Node` class to represent a node in the linked list. Each node has `data` and `next` attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **`reverse_linked_list_iterative(head)` Function:**\n",
      "    *   **Base Cases:**  If the list is empty (`head` is `None`) or contains only one node, it's already reversed, so we return `head`.\n",
      "    *   **Initialization:**\n",
      "        *   `var1`:  This will eventually become the new head of the reversed list.  It's initialized to the original `head`.\n",
      "        *   `var2`: This will point to the node *after* the current head.\n",
      "    *   **Iteration:** The `while var2 != None:` loop iterates through the list.\n",
      "        *   `var3 = var2.next`:  We store the next node in the list in `var3`. This is important because `var2` will be modified in the next step.\n",
      "        *   `var2.next = var1`: This is the core step. We change the `next` pointer of the current node (`var2`) to point to the *previous* node (`var1`).\n",
      "        *   `var1 = var2`: We update `var1` to be the current node (`var2`).\n",
      "        *   `var2 = var3`: We update `var2` to point to the next node in the original list (which we saved in `var3`).\n",
      "    *   **Update Head:** After the loop finishes, `var1` will be pointing to the new head of the reversed list.  We update the `head` of the original list to point to this new head: `head.next = var1`.\n",
      "    *   **Return New Head:** Finally, we return `var1`, which is the new head of the reversed list.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Points and Why This Works**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Three Pointers:** The use of three pointers (`var1`, `var2`, `var3`) is crucial. They allow us to efficiently swap the `next` pointers of the nodes as we move through the list.\n",
      "*   **In-Place Reversal:** This algorithm reverses the list *in-place*, meaning it modifies the existing linked list structure rather than creating a new one. This is more memory-efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Testing**\n",
      "\n",
      "The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block demonstrates how to create a sample linked list, call the `reverse_linked_list_iterative` function, and print the original and reversed lists to verify the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Now, let's talk about the recursive approach (for a different perspective).  Would you like me to explain that, or would you like to ask any questions about the iterative solution so far?**  For example, do you want to:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Walk through a specific step in more detail?\n",
      "*   Explain how the three pointers interact?\n",

      "Response: <think>\n",
      "Okay, the user is asking how to invert a linked list in Python. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I need to recall what a linked list is. A linked list is a data structure where each element (node) contains some data and a reference to the next node. To invert a linked list, I need to reverse the order of the nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but how is the linked list represented in Python? The user might be referring to a singly linked list. So, I should start by explaining the structure of a node. Each node has a value and a next pointer. Then, the linked list is a sequence of these nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the task is to reverse the linked list. There are a few ways to do this. The classic approach is to use three pointers: previous, current, and next. Let me think through the steps. Start with the head of the list. Initialize previous as None, current as head. Then, while current is not None, save the next node, set current's next to previous, then move previous to current, and current to next. Repeat until current is None. Then, previous is the new head.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user might not have a Node class defined. So I should explain that first. Maybe I should write a Node class with a value and a next attribute. Then, the linked list is created by linking these nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user is working with a list that's already in a linked list structure, but in Python, it's more common to have a Node class. So I should start by defining that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me outline the steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Define the Node class with value and next.\n",
      "2. Define the linked list, perhaps with a head node.\n",
      "3. Implement the reverse function using the three-pointer method.\n",
      "4. Provide an example of how to use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user might not have the Node class. So I should include that. Also, maybe the user is using a different approach, like recursion. But the iterative approach is more common for linked list reversal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think about the code. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "class Node:\n",
      "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
      "        self.value = value\n",
      "        self.next = None\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the linked list is created by linking nodes. For example, head = Node(1), head.next = Node(2), etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reverse function would take the head as input and return the new head.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the function would be something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "def reverse_linked_list(head):\n",
      "    previous = None\n",
      "    current = head\n",
      "    while current:\n",
      "        next_node = current.next\n",
      "        current.next = previous\n",
      "        previous = current\n",
      "        current = next_node\n",
      "    return previous\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that's the standard approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe the user is using a different structure, like a list of nodes, but I think the Node class is necessary here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the user might need an example. Let's say they have a linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None. After reversing, it should be 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> None.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, creating the nodes:\n",
      "\n",
      "head = Node(1)\n",
      "head.next = Node(2)\n",
      "head.next.next = Node(3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, reversed_head = reverse_linked_list(head)\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, to print the reversed list, they can traverse from reversed_head and print each node's value.\n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe the user is not familiar with the Node class, so I should explain that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user is working with a list that's represented as a list of values, but that's not a linked list. So I think the Node class is necessary here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to consider: what if the linked list is empty? The function should handle that case, but the code above would return None in that case, which is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together, the answer should include the Node class, the reverse function, and an example of usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user might be using a different approach. For example, using recursion. Let me think. The recursive approach would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "def reverse_linked_list(head):\n",
      "    if not head or not head.next:\n",
      "        return head\n",
      "    new_head = reverse_linked_list(head.next)\n",
      "    head.next.next = head\n",
      "    head.next = None\n",
      "    return new_head\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is another valid approach. However, the iterative method is more straightforward for someone new.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the user might benefit from both approaches. But since the question is about how to invert a linked list, perhaps the iterative method is better for explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I should present both methods, maybe. However, the user might not have the Node class, so I need to make sure that's included.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer should include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Definition of the Node class.\n",
      "- The iterative approach to reverse the linked list.\n",
      "- An example of creating a linked list and reversing it.\n",
      "- Possibly, the recursive approach as an alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user is asking for how to invert a linked list in Python. So, the answer should be comprehensive but not too verbose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing: in Python, the linked list is often implemented with a Node class. So, the user needs to have that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, the answer would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, define the Node class. Then, implement the reverse function. Then, show how to create a linked list and reverse it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also mention that the reversed linked list is a new list, and the original list is modified in place. Wait, no, in the code above, the original nodes are modified, but the head is changed. So the original list is modified, but the function returns the new head.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the user should be aware that the original list is reversed in place, but the function returns the new head.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the code, the nodes are being linked in reverse. So, the original list is modified, but the function returns the new head.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer should explain that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, maybe the user is confused about how the linked list is represented. So, the example is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the final answer would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Define the Node class.\n",
      "2. Implement the reverse function using the three-pointer method.\n",
      "3. Provide an example of creating a linked list and reversing it.\n",
      "4. Mention that the original list is modified, and the new head is returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's the way to go. Also, maybe mention that the time complexity is O(n) and space O(1), which is optimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the user can then use this code to invert a linked list in Python.\n",
