# 🦙 Welcome to **LeetLLama**

**LeetLLama** is a lightweight yet forward-thinking **proof of concept** (PoC) for an interactive, AI-augmented platform designed to empower aspiring software engineers through self-directed learning.

---

## 🎯 Purpose & Vision

The primary goal of this project—beyond _“reinventing the wheel for academic purposes”_—is to demonstrate a core philosophy in modern tech:

> **Artificial Intelligence should augment, not replace, human developers.**

In this PoC, we explore how **AI-driven tools** can enhance the way programmers learn complex topics like algorithms and data structures, providing a more personalized, adaptive, and contextual learning experience.

## 💡 Concept Overview

At its core, LeetLLama enables learners to:

- Interact with a **fine-tuned language model** trained on solved LeetCode-style problems.
- Receive guidance as if from a more experienced developer or mentor.
- Customize their learning journey based on:
  - ✏️ **Coding style**
  - 🧠 **Skill level**
  - 🎯 **Problem preferences** (difficulty, topic, and more)

The goal is to simulate the benefits of a **pair-programming** session with a senior engineer—one who not only knows the answers but can explain _why_ they work, and tailor their advice to your unique thinking process.
